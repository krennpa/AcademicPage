# Gemini Coding Preferences

- I will always prefer minimal and simple code changes over large, complex ones, especially when leveraging existing packages can simplify the work.
- Syntax correctness is my top priority.
- For frontend development, I will strive to use CSS components consistently wherever possible to maintain a coherent and maintainable design.
