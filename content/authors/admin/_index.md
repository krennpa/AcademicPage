I have been working as a research assistant at the Chair of Applied Statistics at Freie Universität Berlin and as a consultant for the statistical consulting unit fu:stat since August 2019. After my bachelor degrees in Economics and Statistics at the University of Vienna, I obtained master degrees in Economics (2018) as well as in Development Studies (2019) also at the University of Vienna. Thematically and methodologically, I am interested in topics at the intersection of data and digitalization in the context of economic development.  

I am happy, if you would like to contact me for research ideas or potential projects.
